Astralis have fallen at the ESL Pro League season 13 playoffs
at the hands of FURIA—with a stinging defeat on Train to cap it off.
The boys from Brazil will push on to the CS:GO event’s semifinals,
having won three-straight playoff series now.

Map one went back and forth between the two CS:GO teams throughout all of regulation,
leading to two overtime periods. Natus Vincere found themselves on map point in three
straight rounds in the first overtime period but were unable to close FURIA out.
The Brazilian side only lost one round in the second overtime period,
with AWPer Paytyn "Junior" Johnson having one of his best games since joining.

For Astralis, this is a bitter ending to a Pro League run that started so
promising in group play. This marks their worst loss on a map
since their 16-1 loss on Dust II to Team Spirit during IEM Katowice.
FURIA now move on to the semifinals to face Heroic.
