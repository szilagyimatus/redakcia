Astralis have fallen at the ESL Pro League season 13 playoffs
at the hands of FURIA—with a stinging defeat on Train to cap it off.
The boys from Brazil will push on to the CS:GO event’s semifinals,
having won three-straight playoff series now.

Map one went back and forth between the two CS:GO teams throughout all of regulation,
leading to two overtime periods. Natus Vincere found themselves on map point in three
straight rounds in the first overtime period but were unable to close FURIA out.
The Brazilian side only lost one round in the second overtime period,
with AWPer Paytyn "Junior" Johnson having one of his best games since joining.

Na'Vi and FURIA was the second series of the day to go to three maps, after G2 Esports
outlasted Astralis in the earlier quarterfinals matchup. The playoffs of DreamHack Masters Europe
continues on Saturday, May 8, with Natus Vincere facing Heroic in the semifinals,
which will follow Gambit vs. G2.
