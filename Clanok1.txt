After an exhausting overtime loss on Inferno to begin the series,
Natus Vincere responded with two straight impressive wins over FURIA on Nuke and Mirage
to advance to the semifinals of DreamHack Masters Spring today.
----
Map one went back and forth between the two CS:GO teams throughout all of regulation,
leading to two overtime periods. Natus Vincere found themselves on map point in three
straight rounds in the first overtime period but were unable to close FURIA out.
The Brazilian side only lost one round in the second overtime period,
with AWPer Paytyn "Junior" Johnson having one of his best games since joining.
----
For Astralis, this is a bitter ending to a Pro League run that started so
promising in group play. This marks their worst loss on a map
since their 16-1 loss on Dust II to Team Spirit during IEM Katowice.
FURIA now move on to the semifinals to face Heroic.
