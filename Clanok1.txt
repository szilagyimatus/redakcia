After an exhausting overtime loss on Inferno to begin the series,
Natus Vincere responded with two straight impressive wins over FURIA on Nuke and Mirage
to advance to the semifinals of DreamHack Masters Spring today.

Map one went back and forth between the two CS:GO teams throughout all of regulation,
leading to two overtime periods. Natus Vincere found themselves on map point in three
straight rounds in the first overtime period but were unable to close FURIA out.
The Brazilian side only lost one round in the second overtime period,
with AWPer Paytyn "Junior" Johnson having one of his best games since joining.

Na'Vi and FURIA was the second series of the day to go to three maps, after G2 Esports
outlasted Astralis in the earlier quarterfinals matchup. The playoffs of DreamHack Masters Europe
continues on Saturday, May 8, with Natus Vincere facing Heroic in the semifinals,
which will follow Gambit vs. G2.
